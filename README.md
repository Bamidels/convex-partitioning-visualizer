# convex-partitioning-visualizer
A Python tool that partitions a square into convex polygons using disjoint line segments. Implements an efficient O(n log n) algorithm, visualizes each step, and tracks performance metrics. Ideal for learning computational geometry, debugging algorithms, and exploring partitioning techniques.
